                PIE creates a digital space to connect various entities in each “C” with a stake in positive change – from producers to service providers to customers. PIE brings together communities, markets, and governments to work collaboratively across the 6Cs towards building a sustainable ecosystem. PIE is built for public good, in service of its producer members, maximizing value for farmers and off farm producers globally. As a business model, it is tremendously robust, flexible, and offers massive scalability.

With regard to individual producers, it results in higher wages, social equity, and thus improved livelihoods. For the customer, it provides sustainable consumption, access to local, culture, and community strengthening produce at global standards with traceability. By 2030, PIE will create opportunities for 100 million artisans and farmers increase their earnings by of more than Rs.120,000/1800 USD annually.

                local work means rural families face pressure to migrate to already dense cities. India has 79 million migrant families, the largest number worldwide. Migrant families are subject to extreme stresses including unhygienic living in temporary shanty housing, lack of schooling for children, and the absence of familiar support networks.

India’s national and state governments recognize the importance of addressing the issues faced by those in the informal sector. Social security schemes have been introduced for some informal workers (mention names) but their reach has been extremely limited.

Legislation has created a structural mechanism for collectives to help organize informal workers, and this has led to the creation of 7,374 organizations with 4.3 million member workers (0.9% of informal workers). The Small Farmers Agri Consortium facilitates the formation of agricultural producer companies. These collectives focus on buying of inputs like seeds and fertilizer, resulting in modest income increase of 10-15% for members. Little attention has been paid to the systemic change that could bring about transformative gains in income. The Ministry of Textiles has a more comprehensive program however, it has ignored the need for professional management systems, preventing the collectives from achieving scale. The establishment of Rural Livelihood Missions that build on Self-Help Group models to promote farm and non-farm production in village collectives have been largely ineffective as they have not led to regular work or real increases in income.
