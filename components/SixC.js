                <p id="first" className="mt-8 text-gray-800 mb-8 text-xl">
                PIE creates a digital space to connect various entities in each “C” with a stake in positive change – from producers to service providers to customers. PIE brings together communities, markets, and governments to work collaboratively across the 6Cs towards building a sustainable ecosystem. PIE is built for public good, in service of its producer members, maximizing value for farmers and off farm producers globally. As a business model, it is tremendously robust, flexible, and offers massive scalability.

With regard to individual producers, it results in higher wages, social equity, and thus improved livelihoods. For the customer, it provides sustainable consumption, access to local, culture, and community strengthening produce at global standards with traceability. By 2030, PIE will create opportunities for 100 million artisans and farmers increase their earnings by of more than Rs.120,000/1800 USD annually.
