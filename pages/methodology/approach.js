        With the clear understanding of the problem, which is that millions of workers in the informal sector do not have access to sustainable livelihoods, nor the benefits that can be accrued from the formal sector, catalyze different agents in the ecosystem that directly influence the status quo; in order to bring about systemic change. 
For far too long, the different agents - government (both regional and national), the private sector and civil society organisations/ NGOs have worked in silos and efforts have centred around providing and delivering services for poor and vulnerable workers, rather than changing the systems that reinforce poverty to begin with.
 
Workers have traditionally been seen as beneficiaries of various services rather than active agents capable of changing their own scripts.

By bringing together the different types of agents, we are creating a means to share learnings, facilitate collaboration and place capable workers at the heart of the ecosystem. Not only will the approach shift perceptions of informal sector informal workers, but will also help redesign the infrastructure that has held back their progress.

The Deep Hand Holding (DHH) approach, developed and tested by the PIE founding organisations, has been formalised into the 6C Framework.

        <h1 className="text-4xl px-20 mt-8">6C Framework and Knowledge Transfer</h1>
        <p className="px-20 text-xl my-16">

        PIE will enable the transfer of knowledge of the 6C Framework to onboarded collectives in two ways (a) Broad Hand Holding (BHH) and (b) Light Hand Holding (LHH). 
 
 In BHH, a core group of professionals with extensive experience in Deep Hand Holding (DHH) will serve as advisors to the management of the collective until they are up to speed. LHH involves the development of a curriculum and training managers of onboarded collectives.
  
 The 6C model takes into account the key components of building a successful enterprise. Each of the components has the input and expertise of different ecosystem players contributing to completing the entire value chain that will enable small, decentralized enterprises to cater to consumer driven market demands efficiently. 
 The key challenge with multiple players is enabling interaction in a smooth and free manner such that the relationships built will serve the overall goal. Here, building networks between each of the ‘C’s can be enabled through technological interventions by bringing them on to a common platform to interact. For example, designers would need to interact with the market to gauge what trends to focus on, and would also need to interact with trainers to ensure that producers are trained accordingly. The technological platform makes constant and simultaneous interaction a possibility.

        <h1 className="text-4xl px-20 mt-8">Ecosystem
</h1>
        <p className="px-20 text-xl my-16">

        PIE takes an ecosystem approach and brings together all the key players that are instrumental in ensuring a producer collective’s success. This includes collective-building NGOs, governmental agencies, private sector service providers, buyers and suppliers. The PIE ecosystem will be organized in keeping with  the 6C Framework.
<br/>Construct – Collective-building NGOs, producer collectives, industry-focused government agencies.
<br/>Capacity – Training firms, universities, skill-focused government agencies.

<br/>Create – Product designers, suppliers.

<br/>Channel – Corporate buyers, online markets.

<br/>Capital – Philanthropic foundations, impact investors, commercial-financing providers.

Connect – Technology solution providers, impact-measurement services.
